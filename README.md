# Spark
Functional s-expression based programming language implemented in Python

## Installation / Dependencies
The Spark interpreter requires Python@3.10 or above, to check your Python version:
```
python3 --version
```

The syntax of Spark uses the idea of s-expressions that's most commonly found in Lisp and since Python does not support s-expressions, Spark uses a s-expression parsing package that converts strings to lists.
```
pip3 install sexpdata
```
